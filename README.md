Dtt - Straddle intraday strategy

BUY ATM - with 50% SL at both sides
Eg: Sold 36000 CE at 200 with SL if 200 + 50% of 200 = 300
    Sold 36000 PE at 200 with SL if 200 + 50% of 200 = 300
    Close the trade if any of sides SL hits
    
    Target 5% to 10% of total premium collected. In this case, 20 to 40 points
